== Description ==
Accentuate most important elements on your website through animation - either when its entering the screens viewport or when its hovered on/tapped on touchscreen (using CSS selectors). It includes more than 70 types of animation (from animate.css library), and provides option to set the animation duration, number of repetitions, speed curve, delay, as well as the option to trigger animation repeatedly every time the selected items enter screens viewport.

Key Features:
* Possibility to set the number of animation groups that you can target with different animation settings (up to 100 groups).
* Add the items (CSS selectors) you would like to either animate when they enter the screens viewport (visible area of a web page) or when hovered on/tapped on.
* Select the type of animation for that group of items (over 70 types, based on the popular CSS library animate.css).
* Option to select the duration of the animation (0.5 - 5 sec; with increments of 0.1 sec).
* Option to select the repetition of the animation (1 - 5 times; Infinite is also an option).
* Option to choose the delay duration of animation when entering screens viewport (0.5 - 5 sec; with increments of 0.1 sec).
* Option to choose the speed curve of the selected animation.
* Option to choose if the animation will be triggered every time selected items enter screens viewport (not just once). There is also an option to trigger animation on hover/when tapped on touchscreen instead.
* Use the preview button to check all of the choosen options in action.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I don't know how to find out what is the selector (id, class or tag) of an element that I wish to target with the animation settings? =

I would suggest using a plugin called 'SiteOrigin CSS' which allows you to easily hover over the page elements of your website and determine the right CSS selectors that you need. That plugin is also useful for styling your entire website without any knowledge of coding.
